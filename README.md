# CSC 456 Project
## Wikipedia Random Article Browser
This is a project for my Advanced Web App Development class to fetch data from an API and display it in the UI.

You can view it in action [here](https://maples3.github.io/csc456project/)

**Note:** The "login" page was a requirement of the class project and doesn't actually do anything - you can just leave it empty and click "Login".
